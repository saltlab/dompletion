\javascript is a scripting language that plays an important role in modern web applications. It is dynamic in nature \ie type of objects cannot be determined using static analysis and can change during runtime. \javascript code also interacts heavily with DOM. All these characteristics make providing code-completion for \javascript difficult. Writing \javascript code that interacts with DOM requires the programmer to analyze the DOM manually. Tools like Firefox provide an interface to analyze the DOM, however this still requires a manual effort from the developer, which is a tedious task. Despite these challenges, this problem has received little attention from the research community. We propose an automated technique to analyze the DOM structure, dynamically analyze the \javascript code and provide code-completion suggestions for the DOM interactions within the \javascript code. Our code-completion approach is implemented in an open source tool called \dompletion. The results of our empirical evaluation indicate that 1) DOM states exhibit patterns in their \css selectors, which can be analyzed and used to provide code-completion suggestions. 2) \dompletion can provide code-completion suggestions with an accuracy of about 87\% and in minimal time. 3) \dompletion does make the coding and debugging tasks easier and faster for the web developers.
